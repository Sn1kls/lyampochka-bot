# Progress log

Newest entry at the bottom. Each entry: date, phase, done, decisions, open questions, next step.

## 2026-10-17 — setup

- Done: repo harness created (CLAUDE.md, .claude/, Makefile, docs/SPEC.md).
- Decisions: Python 3.14 target, uv, aiogram 3 + APScheduler, long polling.
- Decisions: ports-and-adapters layout (`core` + `adapters`), internal `user_id` with `identities` / `delivery_targets`, outbox for all notifications, SQLAlchemy + Alembic on SQLite (Postgres-ready). Goal: a mobile app can be added later as another adapter.
- Open questions: SPEC §2.3 (slot values, timezone, X-debug-key, rate limits).
- Next step: `/phase 0`.
